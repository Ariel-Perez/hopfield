Repository for experiments with Hopfield and related networks.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network)
> A Hopfield network is a form of recurrent artificial neural network popularized by John Hopfield in 1982, but described earlier by Little in 1974.

Î™'m studying these networks for their simplicity and potential to represent a memory in another [project](https://github.com/Ariel-Perez/brain).
